# What is it?
Ghostify-tabs kills chrome tabs processes in order to decrease the memory footprint of chrome, and free up system ressources<br />
Chrome tabs will still be open but in crashed state, so you can reload tabs in need.

## Demo
TODO (gif on how i gain instantly 2Go in RAM)

# When to use?
Ghostify-tabs is usefull :
- Whenever you have a long list of open tabs waiting indefinetly for your attention
- If you are in need of any bit of memory you can get for some expensive tasks (especially for low spec computers)
- If you want to revenge chrome's hungerness ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# How to use?

```
npx ghostify-tabs
```
